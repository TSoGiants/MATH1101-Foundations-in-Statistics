## Program Educational Objectives
The Shoulders of Giants’ Mentorship students at all levels should strive to adopt an attitude of lifelong learning, build confidence as valuable members of a technical team, and embrace their responsibilities as good citizens of the scientific community.

In addition to this personal and professional growth, students at the Copernicus level are expected to develop and retain the logical, mathematical, and computational tools for solving practical problems in science and engineering.

----
## Student Outcomes
Student Outcomes broadly represent the knowledge and skills that students are expected to attain in order to achieve the Program Educational Objectives at their current level of study. At the Copernicus level, these Student Outcomes are as follows:

>(C1) *Knowledge of mathematical and computational terminology used to describe practical problems and their solutions.*
>
>(C2) *Understand the tools and techniques used to find numerical solutions of mathematical problems.*
>
>(C3) *Understand analytical solutions of simple practical problems in science and engineering.*
>
>(C4) *Apply computational tools and techniques to solve practical problems in science and engineering.*
>
>(C5) *Apply statistics to quantitatively test a hypothesis using experimental data.*
>
>(C6) *Apply computational thinking methods to reduce simple tasks into algorithms.*
>
>(C7) *Understand modern professional communication and collaboration practices.*

----
## Course Learning Objectives
Course Learning Objectives, followed by their corresponding Copernicus-level Student Outcomes, are listed below:

1. Relate experimental data in the language of descriptive statistics. – *SO (C1)*

2. Produce professional and appropriate graphs to represent data of different types. – *SO (C7)*

3. Employ Python to handle experimental data and compute experimental outcomes. – *SO (C4)*

4. Interpret simple, practical experiments and test hypotheses using statistical methods. – *SO (C5)*

----
## Required Materials and Resources
*Access to TSoG eLearning (https://elearning.tsogiants.org) is required for completion of this course.*

*A notebook or well-structured digital note-taking method is required for success in this program.*

*A personal GitHub account will be used for both version control and completion of assignments. See eLearning for information on how to set this up and register your account in the course.*

----
## Course Description
An introduction to experimental methods and statistical analysis. Throughout this course, you will learn to describe experimental results statistically, test hypotheses mathematically, and present data professionally. The Python programming language will be used for both data handling and computational analysis to complete several small experimental projects throughout the course.

----
## Lesson Plan

1. Introduction to the Scientific Method
2. Variables and Descriptive Statistics

----
